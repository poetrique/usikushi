to conquer self   
is a dream eternal   
many think to be   
but differ from being free   

how might we   
heal from wounds paternal   
place fear on the shelf   
that anchors Atlas' belt   

---

fire to skin   
and earth to lungs  

kiss your fate  
and bear no wrongs  

---

focus like an arrow  
is blessed  
by the speed of decision  

pursue precision  
from a depth like marrow  
keep your strength undressed  

---

verily, I say to thee  
seek thy soul  
and ye will be free  

growth is birthed by intention  
seek ye not to be whole?  
on tomorrow, pay close attention  

---

I write, create,  
study as I battle with fate.  
her silky threads  
nestle my dreams  
in such ominous dreads.  

"A final warning",  
she whispers as she kisses  
me at the birth of morning.  
blessings abound  
and I shall earn these, all around.  

---

hustler 101:  

even when you fall  
be a better mind  
than you were yesterday  

rise, stand tall  
fast-forward and not rewind  
is the control of the day  

---

be not given to gold  
for her hold  
is bolder than any maiden  

be no friend  
to fame or trend  
for both lie with the raven  

---

your truths are over-documented,  
but growth like ale  
is best left fermented.  

so, take a sip  
from the chalice of tomorrow. Pale  
is the heart, you now seek to keep.  

---

we trip and fall  
off bridges we past broke down  
we then stand tall  
and disown gravity, with a frown.  

why does peace taste bitter,  
when thirsty for chaos -  
when we feast on fumes like butter  
and dance with Dionysus?  

---

approximations,  
and false divinations  
while fair in the past  
do not ever last  

open up to the blessings,  
that reality brings.  
fair and bright lessons,  
like music with no strings.  

---

show your workings  
enough talk about change.  
listen to how your growth rings  
and decide to *live*  

to be human is nothing strange  
in yourself believe  

---

i've buried my last bottle  
a nicotine stub fell in too  
flying now on full throttle  
manifesting on a star near you  

---

i kissed zero for the last time  
cash, energy and all like shadows  

i'm now hero every other time  
'xcept save when i'm in the jungle  

where i'm from, ain't no meadows  
trees and heat - yes  

man stays humble  
no sulking, stuttering; no hum-drum  

by smoke, my ways I bless  

---

i defeated an eternal cycle  
not by data, not by thought  

but by choosing which  
wars will be fought  

do be idle, do make love  
for as the dove, thus is love born  

---

calm, as the breeze on the beach  
after a mid-day storm  
all, i desire is in my reach  
success is the norm  

---

I woke up tired  
Been a while since I did so  
My heart once full of fire  
Now beats slow and hollow.  

Like a phoenix, I will recover  
For greatness is no cloak  
No hat to wear in fair weather  
I taste it in my throat.  

---

Things left unsaid  
On beds not laid,  
Tethered to the sky  
As low as they are high.  

Do they make you wonder why  
He laughs and can not cry?  
The bonds he has paid  
And hopes he has prayed.  

---

I'm happy:  
I don't mean gleeful or smiling  
I mean glad that I've stopped hiding  
And thinking "perhaps, maybe"  

---

as leaves unborn  
tickle the dust,  
as a sword of iron  
is fated to rust,  

as we go where  
no mind has gone before,  
let us find a throne  
and choose peace - not war.  

---

- Study for the family
- Build a bridge to destiny
- Champion who you want to be
- Define your own reality

---

as I walk out  
the Colosseum,  
I hear the hymns  
of demons and angels  

I taste the dew  
on a dry summer night.  
the heavens have spoken,  
I must separate pleasure  
from broken gain  

---

Tomorrow is not dark  
It's beautiful, bright and of heart  
I'm built to build  
Temples in the mountains  
For my guild, as is my part.  

Difference need not be stark  
Reverence need not be blind  
For as the wind knows time  
My compass is to rhyme.  

---

Goodbye to the idols  
Of my youthful self  
I embrace reality  
As I buckle my belt.  

---

growth  
is not a thing of engineering,  
it is  
a thing of honesty.  

---

do not waste your rest,  
do your best.  

wear your change  
as a badge  
upon your chest.  

---

I build and repeat  
I do not desist  
Wins should now repeat  
From dishonesty I desist  

---

you know naught of silence  
and must gesticulate  
sensations in absence  
to tell tale relatable by some.  

---

Dancing on the edge  
Fearing nothing but a dream  
The now is light like a beam  
To get oil you must dredge.
